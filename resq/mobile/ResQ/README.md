## What We Implemented So Far:
- Login and Registration
- Victim and responder profile pages
- Home screen without map implementation
- Navigation bar
- Add request screen
  
**Note**: We used a token in the code for the user page. We did that because we wanted to implement the backend connection functionality. It is not working now because it has expired. We will store the necessary values ​​to solve this problem as soon as possible.
