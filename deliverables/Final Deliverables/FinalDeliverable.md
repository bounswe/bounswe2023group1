| Harun Reşid Ergen | My contributions extended to implementing various functionalities and enhancing user interaction through the addition of essential buttons and features. This diverse involvement allowed me to shape the app's user interface and overall experience significantly.Beyond the initial design and planning stages, where I played a key role in using Figma and outlining the project timeline, my responsibilities included the effective management of data storage and usage. I developed features that streamlined data management within the app, an essential aspect for its smooth operation. Moreover, my work was crucial in establishing robust backend communication. I implemented various service usages, ensuring a seamless flow of data exchange and processing. This not only enhanced the app's functionality but also contributed to its overall performance and reliability. | |
| Volkan Öztürk | Throughout the project, I had various roles, starting with contributions to the decision-making process for our backend technologies. Research led us to choose the Spring Framework, and I revisited and enhanced my knowledge from the previous semester's practice app. I also participated database design discussions. Customer meetings were also an important aspect of my involvement, particularly post-1st Milestone demo, where resource allocation and expectations for the coordinator role were discussed. Active participation in backend team discussions also included exploring potential uses of annotations for our project. In terms of development, I implemented various controller endpoints covering functionalities for different user roles, from Victim to Admin. I also proposed and implemented the use of Specification classes for better-structured queries. I also involved in testing by writing unit tests, not only for my own services but also for functions lacking tests, discovering some bugs in the process. | |
| Çağrı Gülbeycan | I was a member of the mobile team throughout the semester. I took an active role in the decisions made by the mobile team. In addition, I attended all the labs and became a note taker in one of the labs. I took part in Milestone presentations. I helped my team with milestone documentation. I also wrote user profiles in the implementation section. I wrote my requests, my tasks, and the ongoing tasks sections. I also reviewed my teammates' codes. | |
| Muhammet Ali Topcu | We started to the development of the project via reviewing our design documents from the previous lecture, CMPE352. Then, we created teams and I was a member of the backend team. In the team, I assigned tasks to create initial structures of the database design, initial project structure, dockerization of the both resq service and annotation services, and also deployment of them to the EC2 servers. Besides, I also assigned other tasks such as designing the Categorization tree, implementing Authentication/Authorization, enabling HTTPS security, and other API developments. In addition, for the services that I coded, I also wrote unit tests to ensure that every unit of service works as expected. Lastly, I updated some parts of the project according to frontend/mobile requests and fixed some bugs that are reported by them | |

## API Endpoints
- **Documentation:** [Link to API Documentation](https://api.resq.org.tr/resq/api/v1/swagger-ui/index.html#/action-controller/createAction)
- **Example Calls:**
  - Example 1: The most significant functionality of assigning tasks to the responders. It requires a sequence of calls to API. Creating task, adding resources to the task, adding actions to task by creating them, and adding requests to the task are crucial steps. By that way, matching requests and resources with actions become completed. There is an example flow of it.
  ```json
  task/createTask
  {
    "assignerId": 10,
    "assigneeId": 13, 
    "description": "Get resources from ankara to bursa ", 
    "urgency": "HIGH" 
  }
  ```

  ```json
  task/addRequestToTask
  {

  }
  ```
   
  
    
  - Example 2: Another essential functionality is the need creation by the victims, those are the main focus of the application. Whole process aims to deliver their needs, according to specification they made. Response of the need creation call is the id of the created object.
    ```json
    need/createNeed
    {
    "description": "I've managed to send messages on social media, but I need a charging station for my phone. Any help available, perhaps with powerbanks or batteries?",
    "latitude": 40.43,
    "longitude": 29.2,
    "categoryTreeId": "50",
    "quantity": 2
    }
    ```
    ```json
    need/viewNeed
    {
    "id": 36,
    "userId": 12,
    "categoryTreeId": "50",
    "description": "I've managed to send messages on social media, but I need a charging station for my phone. Any help available, perhaps with powerbanks or batteries?",
    "quantity": 2,
    "latitude": 40.43,
    "longitude": 29.2,
    "requestId": null,
    "status": "NOT_INVOLVED",
    "createdDate": "2023-12-25T22:23:57.534262",
    "size": null
    }
    
    ```
  - Example 3: The application allows responders to create resources that they have. This request needs form-data type for file upload if user wants to upload an image of the resource. Response would be the id of the created need object
    ```json
    resource/creteResource
    {
    "senderId": 24,
    "categoryTreeId": "66",
    "quantity": 300,
    "latitude": 39.672,
     "longitude":   30.675, 
    "gender": "MALE",
    "size": null,
    "status": null
  
    }
    ```
    ```json
    created resource object
    {
    "id": 19,
    "senderId": 24,
    "receiverId": null,
    "categoryTreeId": "66",
    "gender": "MALE",
    "quantity": 300,
    "latitude": 39.672,
    "longitude": 20.675,

#### Mobile UI

## Annotations
The ResQ app allows users to annotate request, resource and action cards, as well as the explanation texts of warnings added to the map. The annotation content is text that can be edited from the application. An annotation server complaint with the Web Annotation Protocol was implemented to support the accessing, creation, editing, and deletion of Annotations.

The annotations have all of the mandatory fields outlined by Section 3.1 of the W3 Web Annotation Model standard. The text body of the annotations are stored in the bodyValue field, as described by Section 3.2.5. The annotation also makes use of Selectors, as specified in 4.2. Of these, 4.2.3 XPath Selector, 4.2.8 Range Selector and 4.2.5 Text Position Selector are used in conjunction, as outlined by 4.2.9 Refinement of Selection. The annotation server described in the previous paragraph implements sections 3, 4.1 and 5 of the Web Annotation Protocol specification.


## Scenarios

- **Extensive Scenario:** Frontend
- The demonstration will follow the user story of Ahmet, a victim, and Ayşe, a responder offering some resources.

1. Ayşe is logging into the application to deliver her shopping for the victims at the disaster area. She brought 100 baby foods (resource- material resources) and wants to bring them to the resource gathering center so they can be delivered by a truck driver (another resource - human resource). She will start the demonstration in a logged-in state. She first navigates to the create resource page to create the resources she have in detail and she fills the resource address step with the information of the gathering center that she delivered the resources. Then, she chooses type of need which in this case is material resource and she types a part of what she is looking for (food) and it was recommended to her as baby food. So she founds the exact resource she was looking for. Then, she was able to add the quantity and the description of the resource she have. Afterwards, she navigates to the main page.And she can see her resource at list and map. 

2. Cem has previously logged into the application. Now, he finds himself on the main map page, where he sees different resources and disaster response centers which are defined with annotations such as category, short description, long description, date and location as longitude and latitude. There will be also metadata for annotation implementation of those centers. He then filters resources and annotations by type and opens the details of one of them. He then decides to create a request for some food for his family of four. Using the screens, he declares his family’s needs. He adds to the request that he has gluten intolerance and his wife has diabetes. Afterwards, he navigates to the own requests page in his profile to view his latest request and ensure he has written everything correctly. After a while, he refreshes to see a notification on the top that says a new sooıup kitchen near them.

- Ahmet learned about the "ResQ" app from a friend and thought it could be helpful, especially since he lives in an earthquake-prone area. So, he downloaded the app on his phone.
When he opened the app, he had two choices on the login screen. Since he didn't have an account, he picked 'Create an account' and filled in his details, like email and password.
Ahmet didn't actively use the app since there wasn't any emergency, until one night an earthquake happened. Ahmet immediately opened the app. Once he signed in, he saw a map with pins showing where people needed help. Since Ahmet's building got damaged and it was dangerous to go inside, Ahmet needed food. He decided to add his own request for food.
Clicking on "Add Request" led him to a new screen. There, he chose 'Food' from a list and set his request priority to 'High' because he really needed help.
After making his request, Ahmet wanted to check his profile. On his "Victim User Profile," he found his name, birth date, and role as 'Victim.' There was also a list called 'My Requests' where he could see the request he just made.
Now, Ahmet waited, hopeful that someone would respond to his request. He knew there were kind people on the app always ready to help.
A few hours later, Ahmet got a notification. Someone nearby saw his request and was bringing him food. Feeling grateful, he was glad he used the "ResQ" app.

### System Manual  


### Prerequisites

- JDK 17.0.2
- Maven 3.8.6
- Intellij or Eclipse IDE

### Config Directory Structure - Resq

Application gets the actual path from `resq.appdir` property and checks for **resq** directory under that path.

Under main directory structure is:
- **conf**
     - **appparam.txt**: application configuration items are located under this file (web service url, username and pass etc.)
     - **logConf.xml**: log configuration file.
- **log**: Application writes all logs under this directory

### Config Directory Structure - Annotation

Application gets the actual path from `anno.appdir` property and checks for **anno** directory under that path.

Under main directory structure is:
- **conf**
     - **appparam.txt**: application configuration items are located under this file (web service url, username and pass etc.)
     - **logConf.xml**: log configuration file.
- **log**: Application writes all logs under this directory

### Project Specific Information 

#### Resq
Application context root is /resq/api/v1/. You can reach the application via  
https://localhost:8081/resq/api/v1/.
To reach the API documentation:  
https://localhost:8081/resq/api/v1/swagger-ui.html


Production API Documentation:  
https://api.resq.org.tr/resq/api/v1/swagger-ui/index.html

Production URL: https://api.resq.org.tr/resq/api/v1

#### Annotation
Application context root is /. You can reach the application via  
https://localhost:8083/.
To reach the API documentation:  
https://localhost:8083/swagger-ui.html


Production API Documentation:  
https://annotation.resq.org.tr/swagger-ui/index.html

#### To deploy the backend of the application to the EC2 server, follow the instructions below
- First, clone the repository with command "git clone https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group1"
- Place the config folders to the relevant places given below:
  - Place project_env and project_env_prod into the folder bounswe2023group1\resq\backend\resq
  - Place anno_env and anno_env_prod into the folder bounswe2023group1\resq\backend\annotation
  - Place deploy.sh, annoDeploy.sh and aws-key.pem to the outer folder which containts bounswe2023group1.
  - deploy.sh is a script file which builds the docker image of the resq service, pushes it to the remote repository, sshs into ec2, pulls the latest image, and runs it in the docker container of the ec2 instance.
  - annoDeploy.sh is a script file which builds the docker image of the annotation service, pushes it to the remote repository, sshs into ec2, pulls the latest image, and runs it in the docker container of the ec2 instance.
  - Note that, if IP addresses of ec2 instances change, you need to update the ssh command which includes ec2-user@<IP_ADDRESS>. Be careful that in case of ec2 instance stop & starts, IP addresses automatically change.

#### To access logs of the resq services in docker container of the ec2 instance
- ssh -i ./aws-key.pem ec2-user@<IP_ADDRESS>
- sudo docker ps
- sudo docker exec -it <container_name_or_id> /bin/bash
- cd ./config/resq/log
- tail -f resq (OR cat resq)

#### To access logs of the annotation services in docker container of the ec2 instance
- ssh -i ./aws-key.pem ec2-user@<IP_ADDRESS>
- sudo docker ps
- sudo docker exec -it <container_name_or_id> /bin/bash
- cd ./config/anno/log
- tail -f anno (OR cat anno)

#### To run both the backend and frontend apps on local machine
- cd bounswe2023group1\resq\backend
- run 'docker-compose up'
- Note that, when you are running the application on local machine, you need to update the API_BASE_URL located in AppService.js of the frontend app so that it sends the requests to the locally running backend:
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8081'
