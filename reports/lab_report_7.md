## Completed tasks that were not planned for the week
| Description  | Issue | Assignee | Due | PR |
| -------- | ----- | -------- | --- | --- |
| Data Table Revision After Customer Meeting and With Respect to User-Friendliness | [#418](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group1/issues/418) | Kübra | 14.11.2023 | [#385](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group1/pull/385) |

## Planned vs. Actual
There were many unfinished tasks due to improper estimations in the previous week's report. Most tasks last longer than we expected. We will continue on the unfinished task this week.  
We planned to finish [#360](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group1/issues/360), but we have encountered some problems that we didn't predict. So, we will continue.  
We planned to finish [#369](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group1/issues/369), but managing role-based functionalities take more time than we expected.  
We planned to implement push notification in backend, but it is postponed for now. [#401](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group1/issues/401)
