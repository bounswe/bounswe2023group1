## Weekly Lab Meetings

1. Determining the report wroter person for the lab
   1. Will ask for volunteer person
   1. If there isn’t any, it will be randomly assigned among the ones who haven’t done yet
1. Conversation about the previous week’s feedbacks, works done or not completed, additional tasks not planned before and next week's plan. 
   Also different sub-teams find the opportunity to meet together. 
1. Discussion about the unfinished tasks (if any). Those are important and we examine why they are not finished and if there is any problem. 
   Also they are added to the next week's schedule.
1. Going over the last week's lab report and extracting the main tasks item by item 
1. Analyzing project and deciding what to do next and making evaluations to understand the details and expected durations of the tasks
1. After all tasks are determined, those tasks are assigned to the people 
1. Determining deadlines for the tasks
1. As project goes on, additional meetings other than lab became necessary so we usually have meetings with our subgroups and when the problems or confusions arise, we also make meetings with other sub-groups.

### Risks
- Extended user roles (e.g., facilitator, responder) may require additional fields that we did not consider in the initial design. We will address these issues as they arise.
- We may face compatibility issues when integrating different technologies for the front-end, back-end, and mobile aspects of the project.

## 7.2 Project Development Weekly Progress Report 2

**Team Name:** ResQ (Disaster Response Platform)  
**Date:** 10.10.2023

### Progress Summary 
We have started revising the planning including the requirements, mock-ups, and diagrams. Various mistakes were fixed, some were discussed and many of them are planned to fixed this week. Newcomer friends had access to the GitHub and our communication channels. Separate teams had discussion about their tech stack. Cross-team sync on tech stacks are ensured to be safe. Last but not least as a team we have decided our project name __**ResQ**__ !

- **Back-end team** will be using Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL stack. <br>
- **Front-end team** will be using JavaScript and React.
- **Mobile team** will be using Android Studio, Kotlin.
- We had updates on requirements, diagrams. However, we could not finish to revise all.

## Project Development Weekly Progress Report 3

**Team Name:** ResQ (Disaster Response Platform)  
**Date:** 17.10.2023

### Progress Summary 
Initial code setup for teams done. 
The project timeline is established and monitored according to the "project plan" in the wiki. It may evolve as the project progresses, with necessary adjustments made as needed. 
The technologies that will be used in the project is determined as follows:
 - JS & React for frontend
 - Spring for backend framework
 - PostgreSQL for database
 - Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for mobile

Teams practiced these technologies.
The project branches were decided to be feature, dev, main, hotfix, release, and bugfix. 
Technologies compatibility cross check is done and everything works together.
Additional figma designes are created for mobile. Frontend team decided to update web mockups for the consistrency between mobile and web.

### Planned vs. Actual
- **Back-end team** did necessary tasks, additionally started to implement initial authentication and authorization for each user roles. <br>
- **Front-end team** completed project setup and revised mockups but still mockup revision not completed. Because mockups need to be updated to be in harmony with mobile. 
- **Mobile team** everything went just like planned.

### Risks
- Extended user roles (e.g., facilitator, responder) may require additional fields that we did not consider in the initial design. We will address these issues as they arise.
- It is a great possibility that frontend team can face challenges at jwt bassed authentiction because it requires new technical learning process.
- The map library we have chosen does not natively integrate with react. It has proven difficult to integrate it with react, which is why the issue is ongoing. These difficulties might persist.
