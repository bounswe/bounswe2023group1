# Project Development Weekly Progress Report 1

## Progress Summary
**This week** focused on deciding on the general structures of the teams.

## Risks
- Extended user roles (e.g., facilitator, responder) may require additional fields that we did not consider in the initial design. We will address these issues as they arise.
- We may face compatibility issues when integrating different technologies for the front-end, back-end, and mobile aspects of the project.
