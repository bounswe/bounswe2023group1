# Project Development Weekly Progress Report 1

**Team Name:** Rapid Response (Disaster Response Platform)  
**Date:** 03.10.2023

## Progress Summary
**This week** focused on deciding on the general structures of the teams. We set up the teams for the back-end, the front-end, and the mobile. **Our objective for the following week** re-verify project requirements, decide on front-end, back-end, and mobile technologies, ensure cross-team technology compatibility, and review project diagrams for clarity and accuracy.

## Risks
- Extended user roles (e.g., facilitator, responder) may require additional fields that we did not consider in the initial design. We will address these issues as they arise.
- We may face compatibility issues when integrating different technologies for the front-end, back-end, and mobile aspects of the project.
