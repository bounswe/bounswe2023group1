## Risks
*  Since we start integrating map and various filter based operations, we may encounter with some difficulties related to that.

## Additional Notes

### UI/UX Planned for This Application

MAP:
The map is large and at the centre of the application. Because of this feature, it is very convenient for users to use the application with ease. Because the users need this application to aid them in the real world, a map is the best presentation to transmit the information. The locations of the resources and requests are exact information that can be viewed on the map. There are also multiple resources and requests that the users can pick among any useful. 

Victims can easily view where the resources are located when they enter the application and wouldn't lose precious time trying to navigate it. They can easily see what resources and help locations are nearby without having to contend with addresses and other textual information. Considering the mental workload a victim is under, this simplicity is vital for our application. 

Responders also need to see where they're needed. Visual cues such as this map help them weigh their options and decide more optimal tasks to carry. For example, by viewing the map, the responder could accept a closer and faster task, which is vital in such situations. 

If the tasks were listed in bullet points instead of a map, it would have been more complex and error-prone for the responder. For example, they would have difficulty distinguishing Arnavutköy, the providence and Arnavutköy, the neighbourhood, locations 42 km apart.


The map's role is less central to the application's information architecture for power users such as coordinators and facilitators. Still, it is extremely important for these people to have the big picture of the situation on the ground. The map facilitates this by visualising how many requests and resources exist and where these are concentrated geographically. Furthermore, for coordinators, maps provide a way to see how the different tasks in an action are distributed geographically. This visual helps the coordinator intuit which order of tasks is the most logical.

FILTERING AND REPORTING MECHANISM:





### UI/UX Enhancement Not Planned for this Project but Further can be Improved

ROUTE SUGGESTION FEATURE:

After disasters, some roads may be closed to traffic. Therefore, it would be nice to suggest alternative routes on the map. However, it would be hard to implement this idea with a good UI/UX experience for the users. Besides, it may require complex algorithms. Therefore, we have decided to exclude it from the project. 

We need to use the Google Maps API for showing maps. In addition, we need to learn which routes are closed to the traffic and store them. Afterward, we need to add this information to our map implementation and find optimal routes for the users. All these necessities burden our app with much workload and might cause irresponsiveness.

AUTOMATED ROLE VERIFICATION:

In our application, except the victim role, a user needs a kind of verification. We planned to build a verification process with human action. However, having an automated system that checks the role assignments to users decrease the overhead on the system. However, effort to create an automated verification system is exceeds the project's scope.

Implementing an automated system for role assignments not only reduces the system overhead but also improves the efficiency and accuracy of the verification process, ensuring an easy and secure user experience.
