# Project Development Weekly Progress Report

**Team Name:** ResQ (Disaster Response Platform)  
**Date:** 24.10.2023

## Progress Summary
**This week** focused on updating the design documents and deciding on the general structure of the project. We set up the initial codebase for the back-end, the front-end, and the mobile. We decided on the technologies that will be used. We made several updates to the class diagram and the use case diagram. **Our objective for the following week** will be to connect the back-end with the front-end and the mobile.

## What was planned for the week? How did it go?

## Planned vs. Actual
- We planned to decide on the front-end technologies by this week ([#5](#)). Even though we made a very fruitful discussion on the technologies that will be used for the front-end, we did not finalize the decision. Options are reduced to React and Vue. We will finalize the decision next week.

## Risks
- Extended user roles (e.g., facilitator, responder) may require additional fields that we did not consider in the initial design. We will address these issues as they arise.
- It is a great possibility that frontend team can face challenges at jwt bassed authentiction because it requires new technical learning process.
- The map library we have chosen does not natively integrate with react. It has proven difficult to integrate it with react, which is why the issue is ongoing. These difficulties might persist.
