## Progress Summary
**This week** focused on updating design documents and establishing the project's core structure.

## Risks
- Extended user roles (e.g., facilitator, responder) may require additional fields that we did not consider in the initial design. We will address these issues as they arise.
- It is a great possibility that frontend team can face challenges at jwt bassed authentiction because it requires new technical learning process.
- The map library we have chosen does not natively integrate with react. It has proven difficult to integrate it with react, which is why the issue is ongoing. These difficulties might persist.
