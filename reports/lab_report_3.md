## Completed tasks that were not planned for the week

| Description  | Issue | Assignee | Due | PR |
| -------- | ----- | -------- | --- | --- |
| Initial authentication and authorization for each user roles on backend | [#273](#273) | Ali | 24.10.2023| [#274](#274)| 

## Planned vs. Actual
- **Back-end team** did necessary tasks, additionally started to implement initial authentication and authorization for each user roles. <br>
- **Front-end team** completed project setup and revised mockups but still mockup revision not completed. Because mockups need to be updated to be in harmony with mobile. 
- **Mobile team** everything went just like planned.
