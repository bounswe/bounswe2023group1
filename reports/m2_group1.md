   <summary><h2>Summary of Customer Feedback and Reflections</h2></summary>
  
Feedbacks to and Reflections to our Customer Milestone 2 Demo are collected, listed and explained. 

The feedback received during Milestone 2 includes a point for improvement in the Mobile Responder application. Firstly, it is suggested that the Mobile Responder should allow users to manually adjust their location rather than relying solely on the current location. 

Concerns are raised about the abstract nature of resource types, as users may not be aware of specific details such as the presence of baby food. The hierarchical category feature is deemed useful, but there are difficulties in understanding the category tree, especially on mobile devices.

Suggesting the utilization of the entire page instead of multiple pages to enhance user experience. There is also a comment about the lack of clarity in the skipping functionality.

Commented on the step-by-step design, acknowledging its effectiveness but suggesting that users should be able to see what they have already selected in each step. The concern is raised that users might forget their selections as they progress through the steps, and returning back becomes cumbersome in the current design.

Asked about a use case including a local lead collection needs of victims and gathering into a bigger request which was thought in requirements already. A feature proposed in that scenario was suggested, so that calculation of total people need should be available the local lead.

Suggestions and questions about the further plans on the application are asked, especially resource - request mapping which are included in the coordinates requirements. Those requirements are already planned to be implemented until the Customer Milestone 3.

   <summary><h2>Summary of Workflow Changes Since Milestone 1</h2></summary>
  
Reflecting on our work in the first milestone and also in the process of preparing the deliverables for the second 
milestone, we identified several key areas where our workflows could be improved to increase efficiency and reduce 
needless conflict and communication.

The first of these was modifying the way we wrote our weekly progress reports. Our workflow was as follows: Every week, 
one person is tasked with communicating with every single member of the group about the progress on last week's items,
and what their plan is for this week. Then, using this information and their general knowledge of the project's status, 
this person creates the report. We found that having one person tasked with verifying the status of last week's items
works quite well, it reduces the probability of some issues falling through the cracks and makes inaccuracies in the 
report less likely. However, we found that asking everyone about their weekly plans, writing this in the report, then 
having everyone open their own issues results in much duplication of effort. Therefore, we have migrated to a system 
where every team makes their plan for next week in conjunction with other teams, then each person opens their issues for 
the week. Following this, the reporter carries these newly opened issues into this week's tasks, and only asks people 
their time estimates for each task. This successfully reduced the burden on the reporter, while preserving the accuracy
of the report. We also tried every person inputting their own time estimates on the report themselves. However, this 
was abandoned after some issues were forgotten about.

Another shortcoming from the first milestone we later partially addressed was not having formal customer meetings. Up to
the first milestone, we relied on informal feedback gathered in the weekly lab hours. However, after the first milestone,
we discovered that there were significant differences between our concepts and the customer's. Thus, we planned a set of
customer meetings, the first of which was held before the Milestone 2 demo. We found this meeting to be extremely 
productive, and allowed us to sync our perspective of the app with the customer in a significant way. We expect to hold 
a second customer meeting following the completion of Coordinator mockups on our side. 

Overall, we have reflected on several of our process errors in the course of this project, and have successfully taken 
steps to rectify them.

### Frontend

#### Requirement Validation and Frontend Functionality Review
In our frontend development cycle, comprehensive requirement validation was a priority to ensure our deliverables aligned with project specifications. This involved a systematic review of frontend functionalities, encompassing user interface elements and interaction flows. Our primary focus was on verifying feature completeness and adherence to predefined user experience guidelines, ensuring that every aspect of the frontend met design and functional specifications. This stage also included manual testing by our developers to validate the functionalities in real-world scenarios.

#### Technical Integration and Cross-Platform Collaboration
Concurrently, we engaged in detailed technical integration testing with backend systems, verifying the compatibility of frontend calls with backend APIs, and ensuring data consistency. Correct implementation of business logic in the integration layer was confirmed through rigorous testing. Our collaboration with the mobile development team was key to align our development strategies. This included focusing on API contract consistency and uniform cross-platform user experience, instrumental in maintaining a cohesive development approach across web and mobile platforms.

#### Customized Testing for User-Centric Features and Scenario-Based Validation
We implemented a customized testing strategy for user-centric features. This involved scenario-based validation to ensure the application accurately mirrored real-world user scenarios, particularly focusing on functionalities like victim assistance, resource allocation, and request logging. This approach was crucial for ensuring the application not only functioned as intended but also catered effectively to user needs.

#### Iterative Demonstrations and Feedback Integration
We regularly showcased our application to stakeholders and potential users, gathering feedback and integrating it into development. This ongoing process was not a formal UAT but served a similar purpose, ensuring each development phase met user requirements and expectations. Through this, we ensured that our features remained user-centric and aligned with project goals.

#### Alignment with Customer Direction and Enhanced User Interface
Throughout the development process, aligning our efforts with the customer's direction was crucial. We addressed ease of use in critical functionalities, ensuring interfaces were user-friendly and capable of capturing detailed information. Our commitment to enhancing the user interface was evident in how we incorporated customer feedback into our design and development processes.

#### Responsive Adaptation to Customer Feedback and Future Planning
Despite our adherence to customer requirements, the final presentation indicated areas for improvement. We are planning further meetings to understand and address these concerns. This adaptive approach is a natural part of our development lifecycle, ensuring that our product continuously evolves with customer feedback and current project status.

#### Decision Against Implementing Unit Testing
After careful consideration, we have decided not to implement unit testing for our frontend development. We found that our combination of integration tests and thorough manual testing processes is sufficient and efficient for our current needs. This decision aligns with our goal to streamline our testing strategy while still maintaining high standards of quality and functionality in our application.


### Mobile
Functional Testing:

* Feature Verification: Manually test each feature for correct operation.
* Form Input Validation: Check all forms for validation rules, ensuring correct prompts for invalid inputs.
* Navigation and Workflow: Ensure the app's navigation is intuitive and all workflows function as expected.

User Interface (UI) Testing:

* Layout and Design: Verify that the UI elements are aligned, appropriately sized, and visually consistent across different screens.
* Responsiveness: Test on various screen sizes to ensure UI elements adjust properly.
* Graphics and Images: Check for clarity and proper loading of graphics and images.

User Experience (UX) Testing:

* Ease of Use: Evaluate the ease of performing common tasks.
* Error Messages: Ensure error messages are informative and guide the user towards resolving issues.
* User Journey: Follow typical user paths to assess overall experience and identify any friction points.

Performance Testing:

* Speed and Responsiveness: Check the application's response time and ensure it performs well under different network conditions.
* Resource Usage: Monitor the app's consumption of system resources like memory and battery.

Compatibility Testing:

* Different Devices: Test the app on various devices with different specifications to ensure compatibility.
* Operating System Versions: Verify the app's functionality across different OS versions.

Security Testing:

* Data Protection: Validate that sensitive data is appropriately protected and encrypted where necessary.
* Authentication and Authorization: Test login mechanisms and access controls.

Scenario-Based Testing:

* Real-World Scenarios: Simulate real-world use cases specific to your app's purpose, like resource allocation or request logging.
* Edge Cases: Test unusual or extreme scenarios to see how the app handles unexpected or rare situations.

Accessibility Testing:

* Screen Reader Compatibility: Ensure the app is navigable and understandable via screen readers.
* Color Contrast and Font Size: Check for adequate color contrast and adjustable font sizes for visually impaired users.

Regression Testing:

* After Updates: Re-test functionalities after each update to ensure new changes haven't affected existing features.
### Backend

Backend team uses Unit tests to simulate edge cases and normal cases that can be encountered. Unit tests had already been implemented for the services that were already in place. We aim to expand the scenarios' cases. Additionally, if a test needs to be fixed, we should investigate the situation thoroughly to see if there are any other cases that might result in problems. A crucial part of our testing methodology is putting the unit tests into practice while we implement the services.

  <summary><h2>Annotation Plan and Progress</h2></summary>

  <p>
      The feature of the ResQ app that will be implemented using annotations is designating points on the map as warnings, 
      or useful places. This is reflected in requirement 1.1.5 as well as 1.2.7.1. As of Milestone 2, displaying points and
      information about them is currently implemented in the frontend, and this UI element was demonstrated in the demo 
      using mock data. In the mobile application, work is in progress for implementing the same feature. The integration of 
      these with an annotation server, as well as the UI for adding points, was planned for Milestone 3. To comply with the 
      W3C specifications, the annotations will be stored in a separate database and server. A backend that responds to HTTP 
      GET, POST and DELETE requests to serve, add/edit and delete annotations will be implemented and dockerised. The mobile 
      app and the frontend will consume this API to retrieve annotations. The annotations will contain a link to the JSON 
      content of the tag retrieved from the backend, as well as a Fragment Selector in the target field  signifying the map 
      coordinates of the annotation.
