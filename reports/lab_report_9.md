## Risks
*  In order to complete the project on time, we must complete the tasks on time and speed up. Since our final product delivery is very soon and we still have many requirements to complete, in order to make our customer satisfied, we should increase our speed of development. 

## Ranking of the Requirements

1. **Map-Based Operations (1.2.7):** This is crucial as it provides a visual representation of resources, requests, and tasks, which is key for efficient coordination and response in disaster management.
