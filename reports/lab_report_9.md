## Risks
*  In order to complete the project on time, we must complete the tasks on time and speed up. Since our final product delivery is very soon and we still have many requirements to complete, in order to make our customer satisfied, we should increase our speed of development. 

## Ranking of the Requirements

1. **Map-Based Operations (1.2.7):** This is crucial as it provides a visual representation of resources, requests, and tasks, which is key for efficient coordination and response in disaster management.

2. **Actions (1.2.4):** The creation, assignment, prioritization, and tracking of actions are central to the system’s ability to respond effectively to disasters. This includes task assignment and progress tracking.

3. **Resource Management (1.2.3):** Efficient management and categorization of resources are vital for ensuring they are effectively utilized and distributed during a disaster.

4. **Request Management (Part of 1.2.4 and 1.2.3):** This is important for understanding and addressing the needs of those affected by disasters.

5. **Role Implementation (1.1.2 & 1.1.4):** Proper definition and functioning of roles such as victims, responders, facilitators, coordinators, and administrators are essential for a structured and effective response.

6. **User Registration and Role Request (1.1.1):** These are important for user engagement and ensuring that users can access role-specific functionalities.

7. **Disaster Reporting (1.1.5):** Allows users to add and view warnings, which is important for situational awareness.

8. **Security and Privacy (2.1):** While not directly related to the primary criteria, these are essential for user trust and legal compliance.

9. **Multilingual Support (1.2.2):** Enhances accessibility for a diverse user base. Having lower priority right now.

10. **Multi-hazard Support (1.2.1):** This makes the system adaptable to various types of disasters, increasing its versatility. If we can present a broad-scale category tree, it will cover different disasters.
