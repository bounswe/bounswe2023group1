# Project Development Weekly Progress Report

**Team Name:** ResQ (Disaster Response Platform)  
**Date:** 10.10.2023

## Progress Summary 
We have started revising the planning including the requirements, mock-ups, and diagrams. Various mistakes were fixed, some were discussed and many of them are planned to fixed this week. Newcomer friends had access to the GitHub and our communication channels. Separate teams had discussion about their tech stack. Cross-team sync on tech stacks are ensured to be safe. Last but not least as a team we have decided our project name __**ResQ**__ !

## Planned vs. Actual
- We planned to decide on the front-end, back-end, and mobile technologies by this week ([#247](#), [#248](#), [#249](#)). Each team discussed separately and decided the tech stack. Mainly we made decision based on the prior experience. <br>
- **Back-end team** will be using Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL stack. <br>
- **Front-end team** will be using JavaScript and React.
- **Mobile team** will be using Android Studio, Kotlin.
- We had updates on requirements, diagrams. However, we could not finish to revise all.
